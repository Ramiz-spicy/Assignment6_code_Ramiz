When I wrote the Playwright tests manually in Java, I had full control over everything. It took more time, but I understood exactly how each part worked and could fix issues quickly. The tests were accurate and stable once set up, though getting all the locators and waits right was a bit tedious.

Using the MCP agent to generate Playwright tests was a lot faster and easier. I could describe what I wanted, and it built a good starting point right away. However, I still had to tweak some parts—especially locators and timing—since the AI sometimes picked the wrong elements or caused strict mode errors.

Overall, the AI saved me time and helped with repetitive parts, but manual testing felt more reliable and easier to maintain in the long run. I think the best balance is using AI to generate the base code, then refining it by hand for accuracy and stability.
